# HeartSoundSynthesis

This project is [A LATENT DIFFUSION MODEL FOR HEART SOUND SYNTHESIS](https://zhj12399.github.io/HeartSoundSynthesis/).

We enter the field of large-scale modelling in medical synthesis by proposing a latent diffusion model for heart sound generation, which can generate highly realistic heart sounds. We further guide the synthesis process through text prompts and labels, revealing the research field of prompted heart sound synthesis.

Sample results are available [here](https://zhj12399.github.io/HeartSoundSynthesis/results).

## Dataset
Pre-processing data used in the paper are available [here](https://zhj12399.github.io/HeartSoundSynthesis/datasets).

## Scripts-Outputs etc.
coming soon.
